# hello-world
Learning by doing (creating repository)

Hello there,

I still feel like a complete stranger on Github. I did my best at the GitHub workshop, I read a book, but still...I suppose I just need little bit of time.

I hope that in two months I will rewrite my message to something more accurate and positive. :)
